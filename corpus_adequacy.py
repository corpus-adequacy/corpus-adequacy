"""Mutation adequacy for a published conformance corpus, driven by a manifest.

Standard library only. No Assay import, no pip install, no network.

    python3 corpus_adequacy.py <manifest.json>
    python3 corpus_adequacy.py <manifest.json> --json

WHY A CORPUS NEEDS THIS AND A TEST SUITE DOES NOT
-------------------------------------------------
Outcome coverage is not rule coverage. A corpus can reach every declared
outcome while some rule never decides anything, because another rule reaches
the same outcome first on every vector it would have caught. Mutation adequacy
is the criterion that finds that, and it outperforms structural criteria such
as line and branch coverage for exactly this question.

The bar here is higher than the usual one. In ordinary mutation testing the
artifact under test is a test suite, a surviving mutant is a gap in confidence,
and a score near 80% is a working target. Here the artifact under test is a
*published corpus whose digest is the contract*. After a valid run, a surviving
mutant means only that the declared mutation did not change the declared
outcome on the pinned inputs. Reading that as a hole in the contract also
requires a faithful owner-pinned declaration and rule ownership. So the
required score is 100% of non-equivalent mutants.

WHAT THIS TOOL CAN AND CANNOT GENERALIZE, STATED PLAINLY
---------------------------------------------------------
It cannot infer a corpus's rules from arbitrary source. That would be a static
analysis project, and a tool that guessed would report a score it had not
earned. What is portable is the *method*, so a corpus that wants to be measured
declares its own mutants in a manifest:

  - one mutant per DECLARED RULE, not per line. A surviving mutant then names
    the rule an implementation could omit, instead of naming a line number.
    Generic operators would produce mostly-equivalent noise over rules this
    small.
  - ordinal axes are PERMUTED, not deleted. Deletion is the wrong operator for
    a ladder: the ordering lives in a table a comparison reads, not in a branch
    a mutant can cut. Declare flatten-to-top, flatten-to-bottom and invert.
  - equivalent mutants are DECLARED WITH A REASON, never inferred. Deciding
    mutant equivalence is undecidable in general, so a tool that claimed to
    detect it would be lying.
    - child termination is classified before stdout is parsed. Default
    accepted_exit_codes is [0]. Opt-in unproved_exit_codes is [] and must
    be disjoint. A parseable report on an undeclared code, a signal, or a
    missing code is not an outcome. A declared-unproved exit is not an
    outcome either, even when stdout is valid JSON. An observed unexpected
    exit or signal on an ordinary mutant may be a kill with that class
    named; a control abnormality is control-error and is not a score.

WHAT THE PERCENTAGE IS A PERCENTAGE OF
---------------------------------------
100% here means 100% of the rules THE AUTHOR DECLARED. It does not mean 100% of
the rules the implementation has. A rule nobody declared is invisible to this
check, and there is no honest mechanical fix for that inside a manifest-driven
design: the manifest is written by the same hand as the corpus.

That is why the report never prints a bare percentage. It prints the numerator,
the denominator, the count declared equivalent, the count declared out of scope,
and the ratio between excluded and measured. A score reported without those is a
percentage target wearing a different coat, because an author can exclude almost
everything and still print 100%.

For the same reason an out_of_scope mutant must carry a stated reason. It leaves
the denominator exactly as a declared-equivalent one does, so it carries the same
obligation.

SELF-COVERAGE, APPLIED TO THIS CHECK
-------------------------------------
A group present in the corpus that declares no mutant is the same defect one
level up: the check would silently cover less than its name claims. That is a
hard failure here, not a warning.

    Corpus source -- mutated corpus source, at that -- is arbitrary code, and
    every way that ends badly was observed on this runner while it ran here: an
    endless mutant hung the tool with no report, SystemExit chose the tool's
    exit code, os._exit(0) ended it at exit 0 with no report at all, a printing
    mutant put 6.3 MB on the tool's own stdout, and a spawned descendant
    outlived the run.

    So the boundary is the one the process and batch runners already had, taken
    through the same _run_capped rather than written a second time: one
    deadline, one output ceiling, one POSIX process-group kill. Windows keeps
    bounded_run's stated non-claim -- the direct child is killed, the process
    tree is not.

    WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT CLAIM
    ---------------------------------
    Process isolation for a trusted-local corpus, not a sandbox. The child
    inherits this process's filesystem, network, environment and credentials,
    and nothing here bounds its memory or its descriptors.

    The protocol channel is not authenticated either. Fd 1 is duplicated before
    any corpus code runs and the original is pointed at stderr, which stops
    accidental pollution; it does not stop a child that scans its descriptors,
    finds the duplicate, and writes a well-formed payload of its choosing.

    So the claim is narrower than "a misbehaving corpus cannot make this run
    say something untrue", which is what an earlier draft of this docstring
    said. What is claimed: the classes measured here -- direct-child timeout,
    output-cap breach, abnormal termination and protocol failure -- are
    fail-closed, so none can be read as a clean result. Same-user
    parent signalling (e.g. kill(getppid())), session escape and
    host resource exhaustion remain outside the process-isolation
    claim. A corpus written to forge a verdict is also outside that
    claim, and nothing in this file would detect one.
